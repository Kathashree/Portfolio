            <p>        
                    Hi, I'm Kathashree Paul,a passionate web developer with a strong background in computer science and a keen eye for design. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Heritage Institute of Technology, where I developed a solid foundation in programming and problem-solving. My journey into web development began during my college years.   
                    Over the past 1 year, I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various front-end frameworks like React. I have a knack for turning complex problems into elegant and efficient solutions, and I thrive on the challenge of staying up-to-date with the latest web technologies.
                    What drives my passion for web development is the blend of creativity and logic it requires.
